State machine replication (\smr) leverages distributed consensus protocols
such as \paxos to keep multiple replicas of a program consistent in face
of replica failures or network partitions.  This fault tolerance is
enticing on implementing a principled SMR system that replicates general
programs, especially server programs that demand high
availability. Unfortunately, \smr assumes deterministic execution, but
most server programs are multithreaded and thus nondeterministic.
Moreover, existing \smr systems provide narrow state machine interfaces to
suit specific programs, and it can be quite strenuous and error-prone to
orchestrate a general program into these interfaces

This paper presents \xxx, an \smr system that transparently replicates
general server programs. \xxx achieves distributed consensus on the socket
API, a common interface to almost all server programs.  It leverages
deterministic multithreading (specifically, our prior system \parrot) to
make multithreaded replicas deterministic.  It uses a new technique we
call \emph{time bubbling} to efficiently tackle a difficult challenge of
nondeterministic network input timing. Evaluation on \nprog widely used
server programs (\eg, \apache, \clamav, and \mysql) shows that \xxx is
easy to use, has moderate overhead, and is robust. \xxx's source code is
at \github.

\section{Recommendation} \label{sec:recommendation}
We envision three applications for \xxx. First, \xxx can 
be leveraged by other replication concepts (\eg, byzantine fault 
tolerance~\cite{pbft:osdi99, zyzzyva:sosp07}) 
and record-replay~\cite{scribe:sigmetrics10, racepro:sosp11, respec:asplos10} 
because they also suffer from nondeterminism. Second, promising 
results in \repframe~\cite{repframe:apsys15} have shown that \xxx's transparent 
replication architecture can enable multiple types of program analysis tools 
within one execution, making a server program enjoy benefits of multiple 
analyses. Third, \xxx's determinism as well as its \timealgo technique alone 
can be applied to mitigate timing channels~\cite{Askarov:ccs10, Zhang:ccs11, 
Aviram:ccsw10}.

Moreover, our systems, techniques, and tools developed 
for \xxx have broad applications on improving software reliability and 
security, including bypassing concurrency bugs~\cite{wu:loom:osdi10}, detecting 
security rule violations~\cite{woodpecker:asplos13}, and improving precision of 
static analysis~\cite{wu:pldi12}.

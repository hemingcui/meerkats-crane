\section{Recommendation} \label{sec:recommendation}
We envision three applications for \xxx. First, \xxx can 
be leveraged by other replication concepts (\eg, byzantine fault 
tolerance~\cite{pbft:osdi99, zyzzyva:sosp07}) 
and record-replay~\cite{scribe:sigmetrics10, racepro:sosp11, respec:asplos10} 
because they also suffer from nondeterminism. Second, promising 
results in \repframe~\cite{repframe:apsys15} have shown that \xxx's transparent 
replication architecture can enable multiple types of program analysis tools 
within one execution, making a server program enjoy benefits of multiple 
analyses. Third, \xxx's determinism as well as its \timealgo technique alone 
can be applied to mitigate timing channels~\cite{Askarov:ccs10, Zhang:ccs11, 
Aviram:ccsw10}.

Moreover, our systems, techniques, and tools developed 
for \xxx has broad applications on improving software reliability, 
including bypassing concurrency bugs~\cite{wu:loom:osdi10}, detecting security 
rule violations~\cite{woodpecker:asplos13}, and improving precision of static 
analysis~\cite{wu:pldi12}. 

% P11: Contributions, conceptual and engineering.
% Our key conceptual contribution is the idea of transparent \smr for
% general programs, which has the potential to expand \smr's
% adoption and improve availability of many systems.  This idea also applies to 
% other replication concepts (\eg, byzantine fault 
% tolerance~\cite{pbft:osdi99,zyzzyva:sosp07}). This idea has other broad 
% applications as well (\S\ref{sec:app}). Our engineering contributions 
% include the \xxx system and its evaluation on widely used server
% programs. 
% 
% All \xxx's source code (including a standalone, libevent-based
% \paxos implementation), benchmarks, and evaluation results are available
% at \github.

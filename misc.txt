Patent 1:
Methods, Systems, and Media for Protecting Applications from Races
Publication number: 20150254112
Abstract: Methods, systems, and media for protecting applications from races are provided. In some embodiments, methods for protecting applications from races are provided, the methods comprising: adding to at least one cycle of the application an update check to determine when an update to the application is to be made; adding an update engine to the application, wherein the update engine is configured to: receive an update plan that is based on an execution filter that specifies how operations of the application are to be synchronized; and cause synchronization operations to be added to the application based on the update plan that prevent the race from occurring.

Paternt 2:
Methods, Systems, and Media for Providing Determinism in Multithreaded Programs
Publication number: 20120102470
Abstract: Methods, systems, and media for providing determinism in multithreaded programs are provided. In some embodiments, methods for providing determinism in multithreaded programs are provided, the methods comprising: instrumenting a program with: a proxy that: receives inputs to the program; and determines whether a schedule corresponding to a set of input constraints satisfied by the inputs has been memoized; and a replayer that: if it is determined that a schedule corresponding to a set of input constraints satisfied by the inputs has been memoized, processes the inputs by the program according to the schedule.
